<p>
<p>ISTP has ceased production of the SO_EITLA_LZ series of raw data lz cds.
I wrote this software to selectively download the same data and burn it to CDROM.
Unfortunately, it appears that the orbit and attitude data will not be on these CDs.
Nathan is taking care of this some other way.

<p>To download new data, run GetNewData.  After some data is downloaded, 
the "lastday" is recorded in the "lastday" file.  

<p>Before running MakeRawLZCDs, set "lastday" to the last day used in
the "cdlog" file.  Rerun GetNewData.  Then check the files and make sure that
there aren't 2 versions of files because the first was updated for some
reason.  If there are 2 versions, delete the oldest ones and continue on.

<p>To download new data and begin creating CDs, run MakeRawLZCDs

<p>To remake an ISO, make sure that the CD list and CD status files 
are in the appropriate directories.  Then run RemakeCD [1234].
