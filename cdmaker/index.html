<p>Running the following command covers almost the entire process.

<p align="center">cd $CDMAKER

<p align="center">MakeCDImages

<p>It first calls BuildCDList which reads the appropriate .log file from
$CDMAKER/CDLOGS directory to determine where to start.  It then adds in
directories and files until the size surpasses the `jget CDMAX`.

<p>CopyCDFiles then links/copies all the files in the list and any special files
associated with those dates (ie. img_hdr.txt files) and any special files
associated with lz data.  In addition, it generates the ReadMe.txt file, the
autorun.inf, copies the CD Icon and generates the HTML code.

<p>CreateImage then creates the CD ISO file.

<p>The ISO is then jpush'd (ftp'd) to urania.  If for some reason this fails, the
local copy of the ISO is NOT removed, but the CD making process continues.

<p>After this process is complete, the program searches to see if it can make another.

<p>This process continues until there is no space left on the ISO directory or until it is caught up.

<p>If, for some reason, an ISO needs to be recreated, use the command RemakeCDISO [ql 1204].  
The CD list and CD status file should be placed in the appropriate directory before doing this.

<p>Using the CD Duplicator / Printer


<p>From urania, the printable image needs to be generated for the top of the CD
using PaintShop Pro and the current template (C:\LASCO\PSP\LASCO-CD.psp).  Once the image is made and
printed to a file for all ISOs, the Primo CD software is used to automate the
burn process.


<ul>
	<li>Primo CD Pro (Used for the actual burning of CDs)

	<li>Cedar CDFace (Can be used to make simple CD images)

	<li>Paint Shop Pro 7 (Used to make the LASCO and EIT CD images)
</ul>

<p>After a CD is burnt, it should be inserted into hercules or even a jukebox
given the proper modifications are made to the software.  If the CD is going
into a Jukebox then:

<p align="CENTER">InsertCD lz 0703

<p align="CENTER">InsertCD lz 0704

<p align="CENTER">...

<p>InsertCD will probably need modified so that the CD goes to the proper slot
since the Jukeboxes are essentially full.  After all the CDs are inserted then run:

<p align="CENTER">MountAll

<p>This runs and archives the scripts generated from InsertCD.

<p>After this is complete or if the CD is to be checked locally then:
(this script may also need slight modification due to the location of the CD)

<p align="CENTER">VerifyCDFiles lz 0703

<p>This copies all the jpgs to make sure that they all can be read and reads all
the fits file headers.  It also compares the directory listing of the CD to
the expected file list.

<p>If the CD is to be left in a Jukebox and you are ready to link the CD then:

<p align="CENTER">LinkCDFiles lz 0703

<p>This will check the local files, remove them and put a link in their place.

<p>After the CD has been verified, the CD Volume needs to be copied, labeled and
distributed to the co-invesitgators.

<p>The QuickLook CDs are not distributed.  Only one CD is made from this data and
it is simply for archival purposes.

<p>Three(3) EIT CDs are produced.  One for the archives, one potentially for the
Jukebox, and one for distribution to LAS.

<p>Five(5) LZ CDs are produced.  One for the archives, one potentially for the
Jukebox, and three for distibution to LAS, MPAe, and DSR.
