<p>The LASCO Movie Machine allows the user to reduce images selected from the database
and convert them to gifs, mpegs, jpegs, pngs, mngs, etc. for viewing.
Some of these products can be viewed online as Java and Javascript movies.
The user can also select and view images that have been recently reduced 
by them or other users.
<p>This is still under construction and may still have bugs.
<p>Feel free to place any comments or questions in the comments field on the page where it is available.
Or send them to
