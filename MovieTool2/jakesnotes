* getbkgimg does not work for Seq PW images 


infinite looping MNG ???

convert from gif to pngs and jpgs ????????
convert from jpgs to gifs, p/mngs, mpeg ??????
where do I stop converting?????
do I just save as FITS or P[BGNM]Ms ?????????
if I save as FITS do I add keywords and such ????
is it level_05 or level_1 or somewhere in between ?????


add avi, mov, mvi output ???




finish EIT processing

add text to image ( timestamp )






create imagemedian(real median) - will have to load entire image into memory to do this
	doesn't really seem necessary at this point





* fitstopgm scales based on DATAMIN and DATAMAX keywords if they exist,
	therefore, if they do exist they need to be correct.



look into PIT (Progressive Image Transport) file type
remove jumptoURL from MeasureImg
change MeasureImg naming scheme



starlink software hard to use (so I'm using PBMTools and others instead)

XnView has a converter ( nconvert )  but doesn't output to MNGs yet
	( www.xnview.com )


Tools required
	bourne shell, perl
	pbmtools (www.acme.com/software/pbmplus)
		bins, libs, includes
	gawk (to deal with long strings that awk can't handle)
	cjpeg/djpeg (to convert to/from jpegs)
	cfitsio ( modhead, imstat, pruneimage, imagearith, constarith, tofitsbp16, fitszoom )
		create imagemedian, imagemin, imagemax 		(look at imstat.c code)
	whirlgif (to create animated gifs)
	mpeg_encode
	libpng
	libmng
	pngtomng.pl
	pnmtopng
	pngsize



* LASCO headers fail the fits verification therefore ...

	LASCO FITS files crash during fftrec (fits_test_record)
	which is called in ffprec (fits_write_record)
	which is in putkey.c

		#define fits_test_record    fftrec
		#define fits_write_record       ffprec

	This call must be commented out before compilation or it 
	just won't work.
