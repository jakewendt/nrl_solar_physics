	-	WLISTER.PRO project (working)
			Mike A. has requested a change to wlister.pro that I think
			would be a good project for you, if you have time. He would
			like to see a new button on the main GUI for wlister.pro
			which automatically sorts and runs a query to return the
			"normal" image type for the selected dates. This means the
			following:
			C1: undefined
			C2: orange (filter), clear (polarizer), 1024x1024
			C3: clear, clear, 1024x1024
			EIT: (any), 195A, 1024x1024 or 512x512
			Again, it's not a high priority, but would be nice.
