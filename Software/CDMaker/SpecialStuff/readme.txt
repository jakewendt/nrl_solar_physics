GENERAL INFO:

This CD-ROM contains calibration images for LASCO and EIT on
the SOHO spacecraft. The files were transferred from the

The ISO image was compiled by mkisofs Feb 7, 2001
and written to CD-R using a Windows-based mastering
application.

Images are organized in directories according to the
date the images were taken, and then in sub-directories by
instrument. Sub-directories are labeled c1, c2, c3, c4 (EIT) and leb.
Images are in FITS format (Level 0.5). There are also thumbnail 
JPEG (*.jpg) images for all images.
